local computer. This involves three different repos that together make up the
freeCodeCamp website.

### `freeCodeCamp/curriculum`

Data for all of the challenges that make up freeCodeCamp.

## Fork and clone the repos.

freeCodeCamp, you will wan't to first fork the repos to your own GitHub account,
then clone from there.
