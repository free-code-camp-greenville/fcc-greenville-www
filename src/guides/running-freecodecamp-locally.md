This guide will show you how to run the full-stack freeCodeCamp site on your

freeCodeCamp website.

### `freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp`

[Loopback](https://loopback.io/) application running in Node.

### `freeCodeCamp/learn`

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) static site.

### `freeCodeCamp/curriculum`

Data for all of the challenges that make up freeCodeCamp.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a few things set up locally. Check out the
[Prerequisites section in the Contributing doc](https://github.com/tortxof/freeCodeCamp/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites)
.

## Fork and clone the repos.

You'll need copies of the following 3 repos. If you will be contributing back to
freeCodeCamp, you will wan't to first fork the repos to your own GitHub account,
then clone from there.
