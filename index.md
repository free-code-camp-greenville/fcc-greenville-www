## Hack Nights

Evenings devoted to working on FCC projects and challenges. Campers use this
opportunity to receive assistance from other campers and mentors.

## Presentation Nights

We will occasionally have a guest speaker give a presentation. Topics covered
include job hunting, walk-through of freeCodeCamp challenges, and JavaScript
core concepts. After the presentation will be the normal hack night activities.

## Parking

For events at Next on Main, you can park in the Aloft parking garage or the
Richardson Street garage. Both garages are on Richardson Street, on either side
of the Bank of America building. There is an entrance to Next on Main in each
garage. In the Aloft garage the entrance is on the 5th level. In the Richardson
Street garage the entrance is on the 3rd level. During the event there will be a
virtual doorbell on this page so that we can let you in.
